Boot-WP-Woo
====

A basic Wordpress site framework with Bootstrap 3.x and WooCommerce
----------------------

**Includes:**

1. Twitter Bootstrap 3.x distribution files - css, js, glyphicons
2. Twitter Bootstrap 3.x LESS files plus Bootstrap Mixins
3. A style.less starter file that compiles to style.css for starting Wordpress themes
4. A site.js that compiles to a site.min.js file
5. An index.php file as the base index file
6. The Wordpress 4.4.2 framework
7. The WooCommerce eCommerce plugin and some woo-tab customizations
8. Wordpress config rearranged to allow for both local and hosted DB configurations
9. A starter theme called "boot-theme-woo", ready for customization
10. Added a mixins.less file with many commonly used LESS mixins which compiles from style.less
11. I use CodeKit to check and compile the bootstrap and my own custom LESS / JS into the site's working CSS and JS files. The project includes a CodeKit config file that saves project level settings.

**Notes:**

Clone this repo into any folder, then hook up the theme folder to CodeKit and your ready to Rock!
